## Overview and Origin

---

Stripe is a payment processing software that is integrated mainly with e-commerce wesites and mobile application. It is an  Irish-American company which gives services both as financial and software. It has dual-headquartered in San Francisco, California and Dublin, Ireland. 

---

John and Patrick Collision, the Collision brothers, began working on Stripe together. It was originally partnered with a payments company but later they kept the compnay as private to keep to control all aspects of the process.

---

Stripe was founded in 2010 by John Collison & Patrick Collison. It was initially a private company but later was launched publicly in September 2011. 

Patrick Collison is the co-founder and CEO of Stripe with  his younger brother, John who also founded Shuppa which was merged with Auctomatic that built tools for the eBay platform. 

---

John and Patrick first started working on Stripe in early 2010. As Derek Andersen stated in the article "The Story Behind Payment Disruptor Stripe.com and it's founder Patrick ..", the inspiration came when Patrick, who was working on a few side projects, found it very difficult to accept payments on the web. They tried to find a way to solve the problem and if it was possible to make the entire process simple - really simple. Both of them The two quickly developed a simple solution and within 2-weeks they had processed their first transaction.
After 6-months, both John and Patrick started working on it full-time but they were starting to realize that as a payment startup they would need institutional credibility that an investor could provide. According to them they “didn’t look great on paper.” John became the President and Patrick the CEO.

Stripe received their first funding from Y Combinator. Patrick's earlier involevemet with Paul Graham through Lisp and Auctomatic, and he agreed to invest on Stripe. The amount YC invested was in the $20k-$30k range. In May 2011, Stripe raised $2 million investment from venture capitalists Peter Thiel and added other usual Silicon Valley persona like Michael Moritz and Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and SV Angel.

“Elon and Peter have been very insightful,” Patrick says. “They have sharp opinions on what PayPal did right and wrong. They have deep appreciation for how difficult it is to get there. They fought this battle for many years and it’s really helpful to have someone who can talk about the future in 15-years, but also someone who can empathize and sympathize with the day-to-day considerations. I don’t think there are that many people who can straddle both sides of that. “

## Business Activities:

---

Stripe solveed this problem. They also focussed on going after developers — the main group of people involved in integrating payments. To achieve that, they provided a super simple solution that allowed developers to receive payments with as few lines of code as possible.
